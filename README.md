# Premium-Audio-Brands-Target-eqs
Apply these after applying zero.csv flattening autoeq to your earphone or headphones, you can use squiglink auto eq site.
these are parametric eq files which will try to mimick the frequency curve of these brands sound signature and tonality upto 80%.
My fav one is the dirac, i pair it with kzedxprox in easy effects linux, but you can use eq apo in windows or soundsource in mac or wavelet in android.
Try and enjoy the decent tuning.
